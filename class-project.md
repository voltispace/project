# Python Beginner-to-Medium Project Roadmap

A practical project-based roadmap for learning Python by building projects that are challenging enough to teach real programming skills without being overwhelming.

## How to Use This Roadmap

The projects are arranged progressively. Each project should introduce a few new concepts while reinforcing concepts learned previously.

### Recommended Learning Cycle

**Learn concept → Build feature → Get stuck → Research → Implement → Refactor → Add stretch feature**

Avoid following complete tutorials from start to finish. Instead, research specific problems when you get stuck.

For example:

> Instead of searching: "Build a Python expense tracker tutorial"

Search:

> "How to write JSON to a file in Python"

The goal is to learn how to solve problems, not copy complete solutions.

# Rules for Getting the Most From Each Project

## 1. Don't Build Everything From a Tutorial

Try to solve the problem yourself first.

When you get stuck, research the **specific concept** you're missing.

Good:

> How do I save a Python dictionary to JSON?

Less useful:

> Complete Python expense tracker tutorial.

---

## 2. Don't Look for the Perfect Solution Immediately

Getting stuck is part of the learning process.

Try:

1. Understand the problem.
2. Break it into smaller problems.
3. Attempt a solution.
4. Read error messages.
5. Search for the specific concept you don't understand.
6. Implement the solution.
7. Refactor your code.

---

## 3. Build the Minimum Version First

Don't start with every feature.

For example, for the Expense Tracker:

### Version 1

- Add expense
- View expenses
- Calculate total

### Version 2

- Delete expenses
- Categories
- Filtering

### Version 3

- Save to file
- Load from file

### Version 4

- JSON
- Better validation
- Better CLI

### Version 5

- Stretch features

This prevents the project from becoming overwhelming.

---

# Recommended First Project

If you are **just starting Python**, begin with:

## Expense Tracker

It provides an excellent balance between difficulty and learning.

You will encounter:

**Variables → Data Structures → Conditions → Loops → Functions → File Handling → JSON → Error Handling → Program Structure**

without immediately throwing you into advanced concepts.

Once you can build that project largely by yourself, move to the Quiz Game and then the To-Do application.

---

# Core Learning Philosophy

The objective isn't to finish 10 projects.

The objective is to progressively develop the ability to:

```text
Understand a problem
       ↓
Break it into smaller problems
       ↓
Choose appropriate data structures
       ↓
Design the program
       ↓
Write the code
       ↓
Debug errors
       ↓
Research unknown concepts
       ↓
Refactor
       ↓
Add new functionality
```

That process is what turns Python knowledge into actual programming ability.
